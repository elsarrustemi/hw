Write a model class that represents a die (that is, a cube whose sides are numbered 1 to 6). The class will likely have just one method, throw(), and no attributes. (Hint: use Math.random to write throw.) Then, write an output-view
class that displays a die after it has been thrown. Finally, write a controller
that lets a user throw two dice repeatedly.
Use the class from the previous exercise to build a game called “draw the house.”
The objective is to throw a die repeatedly, and based on the outcome, draw parts
of a house. A throw of 6 lets one draw the building, a square; a throw of 5 lets
one draw the roof; a throw of 4 lets one draw the door; and a throw of 3 lets one
draw a window. (There are two windows.
Of course, the building must be drawn before the roof, and the roof must be
drawn before the doors and windows.
In addition to the class that represents the die, write a model class that represents the state of a partially built house. Then, write an output view that
displays the house, and write a controller that enforces the rules of the game.

Make a version of the game in the previous Project that lets two players compete
at building their respective houses.
